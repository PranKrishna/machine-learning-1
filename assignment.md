### Assignment

The data set is provided in the shared onedrive folder in Datasets as - credit-default.csv
- The dataset has the credit defaults as a class to be predicted .
	- Decision trees
	- Random forest (part of bagging)
	- Ada boost (part of boosting)
	- KNN algorithm
	- Naive Bayes

- Try to use all the features / as much of it for predicting the class ("default") using
- You can present the answers in an RMD file ( alongside of a HTML file)
- Be sure to sanitize the data to use for the algorithm.
- The RMD should contain EDA as a primitive data understanding step before any algorithm is used.
- Feel free to even try the Logistic Regression as a classification algorithm.
